## Overview
This is an application to give users information to cities they choose, information will include weather, yelp reviews, meetups, movies, and hiking trails.

## Getting Started
In theory this application will have working API's so the user would just visit the website and be able to type in a city and have information render.

## Architecture
We are using the following resources: heroku, CORS - cross origin resource sharing, express library, ajax, jquery, node.js to build the back end, Visual Studio, and chrome as a browser.
